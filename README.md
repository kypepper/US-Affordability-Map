# US-Affordability-Map
My code sets up a Dash web application for visualizing the relationship between household income, living expenses, job salaries, and state tax rates across U.S. states. It reads data from CSV files. The app allows users to select a career and view a choropleth map and bar charts that show the income-to-expenses ratio by state, making it easy to compare affordability. Users can interact with the map to see detailed state information, and all visualizations update dynamically based on user input.
